 * Summary: Number guessing game that generates a random number
 *          and let user know if user's number is higher/lower/same as the random number.
 * Modifications: Modified project name.
 *                Removed unnecessary imported namespaces.
 *                Added a namespace that contains class Program.
 *                Modified Newnum method that it generates a random number.
 *                between two given numbers inclusive for better readability.
 *                Added a FormatException exception handler.
